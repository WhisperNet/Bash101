The ideal dir for storing script is /usr/local/bin
By simply moving the script in this dir the script can be called just like
a command .

~ mv script.sh /usr/local/bin/script
~ sudo chown root:root /usr/local/bin/script  #Writebale By only root
~ script 

how does the os know where to find the script?
The PATH environment varibales holds a list of location to find a script.
And/usr/local/bin is one the location stored in the PATH to look for a script  
So by default it will try to find the script in the /usr/local/bin dir.
